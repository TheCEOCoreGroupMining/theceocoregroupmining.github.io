    Core Group Mining is a fully independent Kaspa node running in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. We are powered by renewable hydropower and believe in fairness, transparency, and decentralization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to support miners of all sizes—from solo home miners to industrial operations—with low latency, full transparency, and zero interference. No middlemen. No BS. Just blocks.
