  <h1>Built by miners. For miners.</h1>
  <p>
    Core Group Mining is a fully independent Kaspa node running in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. We are powered by renewable hydropower and believe in fairness, transparency, and decentralization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to support miners of all sizes—from solo home miners to industrial operations—with low latency, full transparency, and zero interference. No middlemen. No BS. Just blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join us. Monitor your stats. Track your blocks. And know that when you mine with Core Group, you're part of a network that puts miners first.
